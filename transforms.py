        sensor_size: size of the sensor that was used [W,H,P]
        time_window (None): window length in us.

        n_time_bins (None): fixed number of frames, sliced along time axis.
        n_event_bins (None): fixed number of frames, sliced along number of events in the recording.
        overlap (0.): overlap between frames defined either in time in us, number of events or number of bins.
        include_incomplete (False): if True, includes overhang slice when time_window or event_count is specified. Not valid for bin_count methods.
